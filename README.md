# Program designed to check if the inputed number was a prime number.
# Purpose of this project was to utilize the concepts behind embedded loops.

# While working on this project, I learned that I could optimize the efficiency.
# I accomplished this by reducing how many numbers had to be checked as potential factors.
# Using basic math, I realized that only the number up to (and including) the square root needed to be checked.
# Anything above this would not be a factor of this potential prime number, as the largest factor would be a square root.

# As a result of being creative with my appproach, the resulting program was exponentially faster when dealing with larger numbers.
# This program can be embedded if need be into a larger math manipulating calculator.
